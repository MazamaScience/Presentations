## Air Quality analyst skills

Many people in the air quality community still use Excel.

Some folks do data munging in R ...

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... so they can continue working in Excel.

--

But R and RStudio could be the _**perfect tool**_ ...

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... for these reasons:

* scripted and thus reproducible
* potential for excellent graphics
* _??? packages focused on air quality ???_


---

## Goals for Air Quality R packages

* Meet the needs of air quality analysts.
* Use a compact data model.
* Use systematic naming for objects and functions.
* Allow chaining of results.
* Provide good graphics.
* Provide lots of documentation and examples.
